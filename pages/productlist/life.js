              <h1>Why I blog about my personal life</h1>
              <hr />
              <h2>BY Abha</h2>
              <p>
                I am often told that I have been very brave in sharing my life
                experiences and their intricate details on a public platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I come to think of it, a smile rises to my lips. Not
                because I feel proud of being considered brave, but because I
                started this blog with full realization of this fact.
              </p>
              <p>To me, it is not an act of bravery, but a choice.</p>
              <p>A mere choice to include the world in my story.</p>
              <p>Even if it means as an audience.</p>
              <p>
                My first post, which is also{" "}
                <span style={{ color: "red" }}>the about page</span>of my blog
                talks about the mission of my blog and why I decided to start a
                personal blog.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like anyone else I too could keep the dark shades of my
                personality hidden, I too could never speak of my
                vulnerabilities, the troubles in my life or even if I would, I
                could keep the gory details of my divorce, health issues and
                other personal troubles to my self.
              </p>
              <p>
                In fact, it’s rather convenient to present only the good, the
                strong and the rosy aspects of one’s life as is common on the
                social media networks.
              </p>
              <p>
                The trouble that kind of blog would pose for me was, I wanted to
                start writing a daily diary. Something that would register my
                life as it is in reality.
              </p>
              <p>
                No hiding the frustrations, no soaking up tears to pose as a
                strong person, no airbrushed emotions.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wanted to portray the pain, joy, hurt, bitterness, despair,
                anger, innocence, everything in its true, unedited form.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wanted to vent out my emotions through my blog, but at the
                same time, I wish to come back to these records from time to
                time to gauge my progress.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wish to assess where am I heading to in my life, to smile at
                my changed self and to feel proud to have swum through the rough
                waters.
              </p>

                Why I blog about{" "}
                <span style={{ color: "brown" }}>my personal life</span>
              </h1>
              <img src="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7-ways-a-blog-can-help-your-business-right-now-5f3c06b9eb24e-1280x720.png" />
              <p>
                This blog is a mission, it holds much deeper meaning in my life
                than just telling the world what I went through, who I am, what
                am I made of and what life made me decide to do in my
                circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>
                I sincerely wish that by sharing my life-story on a global
                platform, maybe someone, somewhere, someday will seek
                inspiration.
              </p>
              <p>
                It might help someone prevent getting stuck in situations like I
                have and find better, timely resolution of issues that if
                overlooked can leave deep, painful scars.
              </p>
              <p>
                I totally understand how many of my readers feel that I am going
                through mood swings every now and then. But the reality is, I
                register all of my negative thoughts so that my journey has all
                the emotions intact.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is an attempt at improving my self-awareness by enabling me
                to see through life more clearly without defying the
                frustration, humiliation and anger that were once part of my
                journey.
              </p>
              <p>
                The world is full of people who take pride in making us feel
                stupid should we dare to show an emotion other than elation,
                anger, boisterousness. To shun us on exposing our
                vulnerabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Letting the world have a clear view of my raw, often unhealed,
                the sensitive side was laden with a fair share of insecurities.
              </p>
              <p>That icky, picky, strange, panic-inducing feeling.</p>
              <p>But…but… but, there is a silver lining to this ordeal.</p>
              <p>
                Showing my true self has opened up a wiiiiiiiiide door for the
                people to walk in, feel a connect and say,
              </p>
              <p>“You know what?</p>
              <p>Me too.</p>
              <p>I too have been there, felt that.”</p>
              <p>
                The first step towards healing is the understanding of your
                position in life. Acceptance of one’s situation as it is without
                any form of manipulation marks the beginning of where things can
                only get better.
              </p>
              <p>My blog is that starting point.</p>
              <p>
                Before we talk about how my personal blog has changed my life,
                let’s pause for just a second.
